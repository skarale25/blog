Hi.....Today I am going to share my experience with Red Hat. I joined Red Hat as
intern. I am going to tell you about my first day, about work culture at Red Hat,
People at Red Hat. So, As I said I joined as intern on 21st Dec 2015. My reporting 
time was 9.30 and I had to report a sweet lady. Believe me when I entered Red Hat 
and waiting in meeting room, I was really scared. But once I met that lady, talked 
with her, I felt AWESOME. After completing joining formalities, it was time to take
tour at Red Hat. Really Red Hat is Awesome. As we know Red Hat is a opensource 
operating system, work culture of Red Hat is also Open and Free, Helpful and Enthusiastic.
I met awesome people here my team lead, mentor, manager and my team. My team lead arranged
Donuts party for me and he wrote some lines on white board.
